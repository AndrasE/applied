          After applying to over 100 jobs, I realized that keeping track of
          applications was a hassle. I wanted a simple way to manage my job
          search and monitor everything in one place. So, I built this app to
          track and visualise my progress. The timing felt perfectâ€”I had just
          completed a TypeScript course on Udemy and a crash course on Vue 3 via
          YouTube. For the styling, I also wanted to try out Tailwind CSS, which
          I`d been hearing a lot about. And with that, the idea was born.

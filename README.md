  Vue 3 CRUD app powered by Firebase Realtime Database
  <br>
Includes OAuth authentication, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript
</h3>

## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

This project showcases a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Firebase Realtime Database. I selected Firebase for its real-time syncing capabilities and straightforward integration, allowing me to focus on the appâ€™s logic and design.

The app was designed to help track job applications after I realised how difficult it was to keep everything organised during my own job search. It includes authentication using Firebase (currently admin-only), real-time data updates, and charts powered by ApexCharts for visualising progress. I also implemented skeleton loaders for better UX during data fetching, and toast notifications using Vue Toastification.

Tailwind CSS was used for styling, offering a fast, responsive, and consistent UI. The app is installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling offline access and improved performance.

For a more in-depth breakdown of the project's evolution and features, and practical examples, please visit the app and click on the logo. You will find an About section.
